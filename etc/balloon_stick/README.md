## Balloon Stick, Cup and Stand

### Stick

The balloon stick is available in two formats (solid and hollow) and three sizes (30cm, 20cm and 10cm).

 - The solid sticks take longer to print and use more filament but are stronger and less likely to break.
 - The hollow sticks print faster and use less filament but are floppy and prone to snapping.

**I highly recommend using plate adhesion when printing the sticks to reduce z-wobble and prevent the sticks from falling over mid-print.**

### Cup

The balloon cup is available in three formats (3 slots, 4 slots and 5 slots). **I recommend 3 slots as the best and most standard option.**

### Stand

The balloon stand is available in two formats (6 points and 8 points). The more points you have the denser your balloon cluster will be, use whatever you prefer. If you are finding the cluster to be to dense for your balloon size then **consider using shorter sticks on the outer ring and longer sticks on the inner ring.**
