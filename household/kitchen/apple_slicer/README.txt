# Summary

for slicing apples

what more could possibly be said.

Update.

So I came to print this file but it was not on the computer I use near the printer.  Not a problem I put it on thingiverse right.

After downloading the file and sticking it in s3d I noticed the file is small and needs scaling up.  I also noticed that there is issues with the file due to poor modelling.

I can only apologise.   SORRY SORRY SORRY

I will start from scratch and put the new one back on  sometime today when I can get chance.

New files uploaded.  Now includes a step file and inventor part file so you can modify yourself
