# Spiral Dipping Platter

## Intro

This is a beautiful Archimedean spiral shaped dipping platter. It can be used for a variety of snacks such as veggies & dip, crackers & cheese or candies & chocolate.

Unfortunately the original file was too large to be uploaded to GitHub so the file available here is a scaled down version. If you want the original file it is available on [GitHub Large File Storage](https://github.com/jgphilpott/git-lfs/raw/main/STLs/Spiral%20Platter.stl) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sowgsfuincdkv25/Spiral%20Platter.stl?dl=0).

**Fun Fact**: There isn't a single straight line in the entire model!
