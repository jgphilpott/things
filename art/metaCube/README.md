# metaCube

## Intro

The metaCube is a 3D printable cube with a recursive geometric pattern.

I've printed metaCubes 1-3 with relative ease. The only delicate part of the print is the middle when all the cube walls are thinnest, the nozzle has to do a lot of jumping around and this can create a few cobwebs.
