# Card Holder/Dish for Playing Cards

## Intro

This is a simple card holder/dish for playing cards with two sections - one for the draw pile and another for the discard pile.

Playing cards can come in many shapes and sizes but for simplicity's sake I have provided designs for just Bridge Cards and Poker Cards because [they are the most common](https://qr.ae/pKxkKk). The designs are also available in single and double deck versions.

The image below shows several other card sizes and configurations:
