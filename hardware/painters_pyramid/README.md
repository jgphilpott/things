# Painters Tetrahedron (Pyramid)

## Intro

Painters Tetrahedrons (Pyramids) are triangular plastic supports that elevate objects while they are being painted. They have rounded tops that minimize marks and make minimal contact with the work. This allows you to paint or stain all sides of an object without waiting for it to dry.

I created this remix because [the original design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6415080) was getting a lot of attention but lacked the ability to [clip multiple supports together](https://www.woodcraft.com/product_images/painters-pyramid-10-pack-new-improved/5c408846776f6f68e00019ec/detail.jpg?c=1547733062) and the sharp top has the potential to leave dents/scratches on the object being painted.

This remix modifies the design to make it a tetrahedron for extra strength as well as being more aesthetically pleasing. It also has the ability to clip multiple supports together and a rounded top to prevent dents/scratches from occurring.
